            <h1>5</h1>
<p>According to Sir Tim Berners-Lee,
  <q cite="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Internet">I was
    lucky enough to invent the Web at the time when the Internet
    already existed - and had for a decade and a half.</q>
  We must understand that there is nothing fundamentally wrong
  with building on the contributions of others.
</p>

<h1>6</h1>
<p>According to the Mozilla Manifesto,
  <q cite="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Individuals
    must have the ability to shape the Internet and
    their own experiences on the Internet.</q>
  Therefore, we can infer that contributing to the open web
  can protect our own individual experiences on it.
