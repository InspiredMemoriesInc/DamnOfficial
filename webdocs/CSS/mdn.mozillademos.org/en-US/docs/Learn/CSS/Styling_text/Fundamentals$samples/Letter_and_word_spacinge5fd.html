            <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

<p>I remember as if it were a meal ago...</p>

<p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
 may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat 
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
 this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban 
predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare 
occasion such as this that he did.</p>
